;;; Commentary:

;; zero.el is auto-generated from multiple other files. see zero.el.in and
;; build.py for details. It's created because package-lint doesn't support
;; multi-file package yet (issue #111).
;;
;; zero is a Chinese input method framework for Emacs, implemented
;; as an Emacs minor mode.
;;
;; zero-pinyin is bundled with zero, to use pinyin input method, add to
;; ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'zero-pinyin)
;;   (zero-set-default-im 'pinyin)
;;   ;; Now you may bind a key to zero-toggle to make it easy to
;;   ;; switch on/off the input method.
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'zero-toggle)
;;
;; zero supports Chinese punctuation mapping. There are three modes, none,
;; basic, and full. The default is basic mode, which only map most essential
;; punctuations. You can cycle zero-punctuation-level in current buffer by
;; C-c , , You can change default Chinese punctuation level:
;;
;;   (setq-default zero-punctuation-level *zero-punctuation-level-full*)
;;
;; zero supports full-width mode. You can toggle full-width mode in current
;; buffer by C-c , . You can enable full-width mode by default:
;;
;;   (setq-default zero-full-width-mode t)
