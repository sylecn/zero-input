;;; Commentary:

;; zero-input is a Chinese input method framework for Emacs, implemented as an
;; Emacs minor mode.
;;
;; zero-input-pinyin is bundled with zero, to use pinyin input method, add to
;; ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'zero-input)
;;   (zero-input-set-default-im "pinyin")
;;   ;; Now you may bind a key to zero-input-mode to make it easy to
;;   ;; switch on/off the input method.
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'zero-input-mode)
;;
;; Now in any Emacs buffer, you may press F5 and start typing pinyin string.
;;
;; zero-input supports Chinese punctuation mapping.  There are three modes,
;; none, basic, and full.  The default is basic mode, which only map most
;; essential punctuations.  You can cycle zero-punctuation-level in current
;; buffer by C-c , , You can change default Chinese punctuation level:
;;
;;   (setq-default zero-input-punctuation-level
;;     zero-input-punctuation-level-full)
;;
;; zero-input supports full-width mode.  You can toggle full-width mode in
;; current buffer by C-c , . You can enable full-width mode by default:
;;
;;   (setq-default zero-input-full-width-p t)
;;
;; For other features, you may check README file at
;; https://gitlab.emacsos.com/sylecn/zero-el/
;;
;; zero-input.el is auto-generated from multiple other files.  See
;; zero-input.el.in and build.py for details.  It's created because
;; package-lint doesn't support multi-file package yet.  See issue #111 at
;; https://github.com/purcell/package-lint/issues/111
