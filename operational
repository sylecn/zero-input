- DONE make zero-input-quickdial IM work in emacs.
  see ~/lisp/elisp/zero/zero-input-quickdial.el
- DONE make zero-input-table IM work in emacs. with zero-input-panel.
  see ~/lisp/elisp/zero/zero-input-table.el
- during development, press F8 to byte-compile and load the current el file.
  this will also look for errors in the file.

  press F9 to run ert tests.
- TODOs
  - whenever a command moves point, IM should probably reset()
    I can't remap every possible key/function.

  - I need hook for buffer/window focus in/out.
    currently, when user switch to another buffer, the panel will still show.

    user can click mouse in another emacs window.
    whenever focus is moved outside current buffer, I need a hook to run
    zero-input-focus-out.

    how to reproduce the problem
    =============================
    open emacs, split, top window show buffer with file t3, bottom window show
    buffer with file t4.

    in t3 buffer, press F1 to toggle zero on. type "a", candidate list will
    show. now press C-x o to switch to t4 buffer. candidate list didn't go
    away. because I can't find a hook for it.

    the mouse case:
    =================
    open emacs, split, top window show buffer with file t3, bottom window show
    buffer with file t4.

    in t3 buffer, press F1 to toggle zero on. type "a", candidate list will
    show. now click mouse on t4 buffer. candidate list didn't go away. because
    I can't find a hook for it.

  - how to check whether string contains character?
    without converting char to string.

    (zero-input-table-can-start-sequence) can use this.

- is it easy to implement in elisp?

  try it in self-insert-command hook.
  post-self-insert-hook

  (add-hook 'post-self-insert-hook #'t1-replace-chinese-dot-maybe nil t)

  see ~/lisp/elisp/testing-only/auto-fix-typing-via-self-insert-command-hook.el

  it works.
  when I type 1a3 it will insert 1.3.

- I think this can probably work outside zero-input.
  nope. zero doesn't use self-insert-command for inserting Chinese dot.

  what does it use?
  zero-input-pinyin-handle-preedit-char

  it should be easy to implement the same thing there.
  - when commit digit, just also add digit in a ring buffer. and check whether
    there is a Chinese dot to be replaced.
  - when commit Chinese dot, add Chinese dot in a ring buffer.

  // These digits and Chinese dot is not part of key IM logic.
  // zero-input-can-start-sequence will return false for them.
  // I don't even need to change zero-input-commit-text.

- put the feature under a flag.
  zero-input-auto-fix-dot-between-numbers

- problems
  - how to get last insert char?
  - how to get last 3 char from a string?
    (equal (substring "abcde" -3) "cde")
    (equal (substring "abc" -3) "abc")
    (equal (substring "ab" -3) "ab")

    how to loop characters over a string?
    (mapcar (lambda (ch) ch) "abc")
  - in elisp, use #'(lambda (x) x) or (lambda (x) x)?
    Anonymous Functions - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual
    https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Anonymous-Functions.html
    use #' is better. it is short for (function (lambda (x) ...)).
  - DONE return key should also insert ?\n to ring buffer.
    bug reproduce:
    type
    25。<ret>
    6
    it is converted to
    25。.6

    where is return key handled when not in preedit mode?

    debug log:
    user typed: .
    cannot start sequence, state=IM_WAITING_INPUT
    press <ret> doesn't get any debug output.

    ret is handled here:
    (define-key zero-input-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'zero-input-return)
    (define-key zero-input-mode-map (kbd "RET") nil)

    When not in preedit-mode, I use system default self-insert-command binding
    for RET key. So I still need the hook.

    (add-hook 'post-self-insert-hook #'zero-input-post-self-insert nil t)

    - when I do this, digit key press will insert twice into ring.
      fixed. only use post-self-insert-hook, drop my explicit call.
    - when type 。 it is not added to ring buf.
      // it is added, just doesn't have debug log. because it uses mapc to add ch
      // to ring.

      The hook function should handle auto fix Chinese dot in digits.
      now it works.

  - WONTFIX backspace should update ring buffer. Oh, I can't restore old char.
    just remove the newest item in the ring buffer.

    e.g. 1<backspace>。6 should not be converted to ".6".

    (define-key zero-input-mode-map (kbd "<backspace>") 'zero-input-backspace)
    // I don't do anything here. auto fix doesn't work with preedit mode.

    (define-key zero-input-mode-map (kbd "<backspace>") nil)

    backspace doesn't run self-insert-command in many major modes.
    There is nothing I can do.
    Is there a hook I can use?
    delete-char

  - DONE only do auto fix when zero-input-mode is on.

  - DONE when zero is off, clear the ring buffer.
    do it in zero-input-reset.

** 2020-02-04 zero-input-pinyin, allow switch between sync and async mode in runtime.
title was: zero-input-pinyin.el why sometimes it uses sync call and sometimes
it uses async call?

- debug log.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    zero-input-pinyin building candidate list synchronously
    zero-input-pinyin building candidate list asynchronously
  #+END_SRC

  zero-input-pinyin.el why sometimes it uses sync call and sometimes it
  uses async call? I think every async call should chain back to sync
  call.

  I think when a call is triggered from zero-framework.el, it will always
  be sync call. when a call is triggered from zero-pinyin.el, it MAY used
  async call directly.

  who calls zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates-async

  - zero-input-pinyin-preedit-str-changed
    calls framework's version. which use default async call. and chains to
    zero-pinyin sync call.
  - zero-input-pinyin-pending-preedit-str-changed
    uses async call.
  - zero-input-pinyin-page-down
    uses async call.

  No wonder zero-pinyin sync and async performance is on par. Because sync
  call is not used much.
- How to use sync or async call in all places? I don't want to mix it.
  just enable async in IM register code? confirmed enable async will only
  use async version.

  how to switch to sync version only?
- implementation
  - added zero-input-pinyin-use-async-fetch flag variable.
  - added zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates-unified, it will call sync or
    async version based on the flag.
- problems
  - how to be able to switch between sync and async version in runtime?
    now I can switch it in build time, but how to switch it in runtime?

    It's mainly about the im register code.

    I have to provide a method to do it. a variable is not enough.
    Because I need to update the IM class method slot value.

    also, why show candidates are called twice?
  - can I trace zero-input-fetch-size variable in emacs lisp?

    replace byte-compiled version with non-byte-compiled version.

    Command: debug-on-entry function-name
    Command: cancel-debug-on-entry &optional function-name
  - I have a feeling of what's wrong.
    since the value is last time's fetch size.
    max of something, that something is not set properly.
    not zero-input-fetch-size itself.

    length of candidates. the candidates list is not updated in time or in
    correct order.

    yes. zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates doesn't set zero-input-candidates
    variable in time.

    who/when sets zero-input-candidates after fetching new candidates?

    in zero-input-framework.el, zero-input-build-candidates.

    it's override in zero-input-pinyin.el zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates.

    why zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates return the candidates as result. I
    think the return value is discarded. the return value is used by async
    complete function, used in default async implementation.

    how to distinguish between async and sync fetch?
    in async fetch, should update zero-input-candidates when fetch finished.
    in sync fetch, should update zero-input-candidates right away.
    I don't need to distinguish them, if zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates is
    called, it is using sync fetch. There is no time delay or async io.
  - DONE when is sync version used, when is async version used?
    // sync version is always called via async-func.

    zero-input-pinyin-page-down always call async verison.
    it relies on zero-input-build-candidates-complete to set
    zero-input-candidates variable.

    - when preedit-str changes.
      zero-input-preedit-str-changed
      calls zero-input-build-candidates-async-func

    - when user press = goto next page.
      zero-input-page-down
      calls zero-input-build-candidates-async-func

    - so sync version is always called via async-func.

    - zero-input-build-candidates-complete is not used properly in
      zero-input-page-down. do not reuse zero-input-build-candidates-complete
      function, just inline what should be called.

      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        (defun zero-input-build-candidates-complete (candidates)
          "Called when `zero-input-build-candidates-async' return.

        CANDIDATES is returned candidates list from async call."
          (setq zero-input-candidates candidates)
          (zero-input-show-candidates candidates))
      #+END_SRC
      this is where two show-candidates calls are made.
      now fixed.

    - double check zero-input-pinyin-build-candidates-async doesn't do the
      same thing that the callback function already did.

      it has done it twice.
      fixed.

    - zero-input-framework.el sync/async version is not quite right.
      zero-input-pinyin.el async version is not being used? It's okay.
      does sync version work as expected?

      the two "external" use case always call async version, so sync version
      is only used to build candidates, and I confirm it doesn't need to
      update metadata.

** 2019-11-10 space doesn't work in full-width mode.
全角和半角 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书
https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%A8%E5%BD%A2%E5%92%8C%E5%8D%8A%E5%BD%A2

ascii   full-width unicode codepoint.
0x20 	"　" 	U+3000

- add a failing unit test.

** 2019-11-07 full width mode no longer works. why?
C-c , . enabled full-width mode.
but modeline is not changed.
type digit just insert half-width char.

zero-input-full-width-p

it's always nil.
check zero-input-toggle-full-width

- defvar-local and setq problem.
  (defvar-local zero-input-full-width-p nil)
  (setq zero-input-full-width-p (not zero-input-full-width-p))

  maybe setq doesn't set buffer local variable when it is defined as
  defvar-local.

  eval (zero-input-toggle-full-width) inside zero buffer does work.
  but press C-c ,. doesn't change the variable in zero buffer.

  C-c ,, zero-input-cycle-punctuation-level does work.

- read buffer-local variables.
  Info: (elisp) Buffer-Local Variables

  A variable can have buffer-local bindings in some buffers but not in other
  buffers.  The default binding is shared by all the buffers that don’t have
  their own bindings for the variable.

- check how it is done in old code. before defvar-local.
  git show a8e2341f978d64d6068bb564ad15e896e810e21b -- zero-input-framework.el

  (make-local-variable 'zero-input-full-width-mode)
  I think I need this back.
  defvar-local only make variable buffer local when it is set for the first
  time. maybe that's not enough.

  first call to C-c,. should be "enabled full-width mode"

- 2019-11-10 it's said 2.0.0 also have problem.

  add (make-local-variable 'zero-input-full-width-mode) in minor mode init
  works.

  are there other similar problems for local variables?

  defvar-local is not the same as make-local-variable.
  because if you only read the variable, it will get a global value.

  defvar-local is similar to make-variable-buffer-local. both only create a
  buffer local binding on first set.

  use setq-local is equivalent to make-local-variable and setq.

** 2019-11-03 review advice from riscy.
riscy, thanks for the review. Some quite good advice there.

Here are changes I have made.

- dropped Package-Version metadata. Version was there from the start.
- zero-input-full-width-mode renamed to zero-input-full-width-p.
- zero-input-toggle is now an obsolete alias for zero-input-mode.
  updated docstring to suggest user bind key to zero-input-mode.
- use defvar-local when variable is always buffer local.
  git grep make-local-variable
- moved test data to debug/test files.
- Comments on keeping just one `provide' call for zero-input.el

  It's easy to fix in build script. But I have kept multiple provide calls for
  the following reasons:

  - All features provided are in fact independent modules. They can be
    optionally loaded, they could have alternative implementations, and some
    can be reused in other emacs lisp projects.
  - Test file for each feature only require that feature, not all of
    zero-input.el. If only one provide is used, test file have to require the
    whole thing, or I will need different require call for development code
    and released code.
  - The one file zero-input.el is only created for easier distribution. I
    would like to switch to multi-file distribution when package-lint supports
    multi-file packages.

  If possible, I would like to keep the multiple provide calls.
- fixed typo. zero-input-pinin-service > `zero-input-pinyin-service'.

- implementation
  - test zero-input-mode function works fine when bind to a key.
- problems
  - when use one `provide' call. tests (require 'zero-input-panel) won't work.
  - test in emacs -Q. press f5 zero-input-mode, type anything result in
    English text. M-x zero-on does work.

    zero-input-on and zero-input-off have more to do than just set the minor
    mode on and off.

    Can I do those via hooks?

    - zero-input-on, can just do it at minor mode definition.
    - zero-input-off, it calls reset and set-state.
    - all fixed. just use emacs generated zero-input-mode function.  always
      reset when minor mode is enabled. there is no need to reset when minor
      mode is turned off.

** 2019-10-15 make package-lint happy on all el files.
- package-lint doesn't support multi-file package.

  Need to add headers to make it happy.

  Because it doesn't have concept on multi-file package, it insists all
  functions in file start with file name prefix. I can't have zero-input-* utility
  function in zero-input-panel.el

- M-x package-lint-current-buffer fail on zero.el file
  this line:
  (eval-when-compile (require 'cl-macs))

  M-x package-lint-current-buffer fails on a fresh .el file with just that
  line.

  'warning
  "This file is not in the `cl-lib' ELPA compatibility package: require `cl-lib' instead."

  says you should use cl-lib instead. may as well try that.
  yes. that works.

- create a single file for distribution.
  package-lint doesn't support multiple file pkg yet.

  - create a single zero.el file for distribution.
    rename current zero.el to zero-input-framework.el
    create zero.el.in
  - make build
    should generate zero.el and run checks on it.
  - insert content to zero.el.in
    ;;; Code:
    ;;; .*\.el ends here
  - now package-lint should be fine.
  - I should I put zero.el in a branch or a separate git repo?
    separate git repo is better.
    how to auto build and commit on source repo push?
    use gocd CI, I can trigger a build. just run git add and git push there?
    if run in the same repo, two branch is required.
  - maybe just add zero.el in master branch and commit it anyway.
  - 

** 2019-10-11 move tests to separated files.
otherwise (require 'zero-input-pinyin) will fail because (require 'ert) is not in
source code.

- problems
  - should I create two pkg, one for zero-framework and one for zero-pinyin?
    does melpa require two repo for this?
  - minimum s version?
    I only use s-contains-p s-join.
    checked github
    tag 1.2.0 already include these functions.

    // seems my pkg compile just fine.
  - how to add autoload magic comments?

    https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Autoload.html

    A magic autoload comment (often called an autoload cookie) consists of
    ‘;;;###autoload’, on a line by itself, just before the real definition of
    the function in its autoloadable source file.

    add this for some user commands.
    zero-set-im
    zero-set-default-im
    zero-on
    zero-toggle
  - run package-lint
  - Prefix function names with #’ (i.e., the special form function) instead of
    just ’ (i.e., the special form quote) to tell the compiler this is a
    function reference. E.g., (seq-filter #'evenp list).

    I don't think this is necessary in my code.
  - do I need to fix all checkdoc problems for my pkg to be accepted by melpa?
    search: melpa checkdoc one liner functions docstring

    yes. they require all checkdoc problem be fixed.
    Add recipe for a.el by dotemacs · Pull Request #4830 · melpa/melpa
    https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/4830

    how to specify minimum emacs version?
    ;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24"))
  - DONE fix all checkdoc problems.
    // except for zero-mode, which I don't know how to fix. all other problems
    fixed.
    - Disambiguate zero-mode by preceding w/ function,command,variable,option
      or symbol. (C-h,f,e,n,p,q) [4 times]

      this one is really confusing.
      org-mode-map doesn't do this.
      magit-mode-map doesn't do this.
  - TODO how to add dbus as dependencies?
    some emacs build may not have dbus.
    (require 'dbus)

    also how to only allow install on linux? when I test it dbus only worked
    in linux.

    what's the correct syntax for specifying dbus as dependency?
    (dbus "1.0")
    didn't work.
  - search: package-install-file package--description-file: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil
    search: emacs package-install-file install tar package--description-file: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil

    install from dir is okay.
    install from tar is not. Not sure what's wrong.

** 2019-10-08 support full-width characters and symbols.
全角 半角

- feature requests
  - when zero-mode is on, and in full-width mode
    - commit English character and symbol should commit full-width character
      if there is a full-width character. This should happen before checking
      punctuation mapping. if a map is found, punctuation mapping is ignored.
    - type letters should still go into preedit str, only commit full-width
      char when user press RET.
  - when zero-mode is on, and in half-width mode (the default)
    - do what it does now. punctuation mapping is checked.

- implementation
  - Block Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms – Codepoints
    https://codepoints.net/halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms
  - how to support full width character and symbol in zero?
    update fsm table.

    add a zero-full-width-mode variable
    add default binding shift+space, M-x zero-toggle-full-width-mode

    use modeline LIGHTER to show full/half width mode.
    when in full-width mode, show ZeroF.

    FSM table:
    move from gtk-im-module-zero operational file.
  - updated FSM.
    so it's only a few changes.
    - when insert character that can't start a sequence, insert char should be
      full-width aware.

      zero-self-insert-command
      DONE zero-commit-preedit-str
      DONE zero-convert-punctuation

    - when commit preedit str, insert should be full-width aware.
    - when insert Chinese punctuation character, insert should be full-width aware.

  - why bind S-SPC key in zero-mode-map didn't work.
    global-set-key does work.

    shift-space is always translated to space in minor mode?
    shift is not registered as key prefix.

    I will just use another key binding for this command.
    try M-space. nope.

    https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Keymaps-and-Minor-Modes.html#Keymaps-and-Minor-Modes
    Minor modes may bind commands to key sequences consisting of C-c followed
    by a punctuation character. However, sequences consisting of C-c followed
    by one of {}<>:;, or a control character or digit, are reserved for major
    modes. Also, C-c letter is reserved for users. See Key Binding
    Conventions.

    try use C-c , , and C-c , .

    how to add C-c , as prefix key and add binding for those two commands?
    it works.

  - elisp how to convert unicode hex to char?
    1. Non-ASCII Characters
    https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/elisp-manual-21-2.8/html_chapter/elisp_33.html#SEC541

    FF01 to FF65    only 65 chars. I will just type it.
    "\uff01" ！

    char to code point:
    (split-char ?\)(unicode 0 255 1)

    # FF01
    (split-char ?\！)(unicode 0 255 1)
    (insert (make-char 'unicode 0 255 1))
    (split-char ?\!)(ascii 33)
    # FF5A
    (split-char ?\ｚ)(unicode 0 255 90)
    (insert (make-char 'unicode 0 255 90))

    # FF65
    (split-char ?\･)(unicode 0 255 101)

    ascii [33, 122]
    map to
    unicode 0 255 [1, 101].

    then pick a few others if they are of importance.

  - commit preedit str in full-width mode didn't work.
    it still commit half-width str.

    is zero-commit-preedit-str called at all? there is no debug message.
    that is for commit preedit-str when there is no candidate.

    when I press RET, the code is in zero-return.

  - type = will insert both full-width char and half-width char.
    fixed.
